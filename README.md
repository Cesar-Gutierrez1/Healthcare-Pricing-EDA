# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes a synthetic healthcare dataset consisting of 10,000 patient records.  
The dataset includes patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital admission details.

The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create visualizations to uncover trends and insights related to healthcare services.

**Note:** This dataset is entirely synthetic and intended for educational purposes. No real patient data is used.
